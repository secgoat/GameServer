GameServer
==========

Creating the base for a multiplayer networked game. This will start as the basic client / server components 
and progress from there.

Trying to get the base component down so that later down the road I do not have to rewrite a lot of code 
to get a single player game to be multiplayer. This way I keep multiplayer in mind and mold my code to fit
that style.
